# Writing Blog Posts

nteract blog posts are written by people all across our community, not just those with “writer” in their job titles. We love having experts from around the community blog about their work and their ideas. The person most familiar with the subject is in the best position to convey it, and the members of the community can help with brainstorming and editing as needed.

The guidelines below outline things to keep in mind when writing a blog post for the nteract blog.

## Basics

We update the main nteract blog a couple times every week. We generally publish:

* Feature, release, and integration announcements
* nteract user case studies
* Tips and tricks for data scientists, software engineers, data engineers, and researchers
* Examples of how we use nteract’s features in our own marketing

We publish blog posts that explain the “why” behind the work we do at nteract. We want to show people that we're an industry leader with the best products, and we use our blog to tell the stories behind those products.

## Guidelines

When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](/02-voice-and-tone.html.md) and [Grammar and mechanics](/04-grammar-and-mechanics.html.md) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Be casual, but smart
This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

### Be specific
If you're writing about data, put the numbers in context. If you're writing about a nteract user, give the reader plenty of information about their experiences, workflow, results, and values.

### Get to the point
Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads. Our users are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Link it up
Feel free to link away from nteract if it helps you explain something.

### Make 'em LOL
nteract is a fun open source project, and we want our blog to reflect this. Feel free to throw in a joke here and there, or link out to a funny GIF or YouTube video when appropriate. Just don't overdo it.

### Use tags and keywords
In our Medium site, add tags that apply to your article. Look through existing posts for common tags. If you’re not sure if a word should be a tag, it probably shouldn’t.

### Use pictures
Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you’re explaining how to use nteract, include screenshots to illustrate your point. Make sure to use alt text.
