# Welcome to the nteract Content Style Guide

This content guide is based on the [open-source content style guide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/) provided by Mailchimp. This guide will help nteract maintainers, contributors, and maintainers craft effective narratives when writing about nteract, or anything else for that matter.

## Using this content guide

You can use this guide to help you write clearly and consistently across blog posts, emails, code comments, and more.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. It’s not traditional in format or content. We break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.

## Contributing to this guide
