# Voice and Tone

One way we write empowering content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone and lays out the elements of each as they apply to nteract.

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss.

Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing.

The same is true for nteract. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

## Voice

At nteract, we know that the field of interactive computing is riddled with new concepts and strange terminology. That’s why we share our knowledge in a compassionate and understanding tone. We want to educate and empower people without patronizing or confusing them. 

Using offbeat humor and a conversational voice, we play with language to bring joy to our content. We prefer the subtle over the noisy, the wry over the farcical. We don't take ourselves too seriously.

Whether people know what they need from us or don’t know the first thing about the world of interactive computing, every word we say informs and encourages. We impart our expertise with clarity, empathy, and wit. 

All of this means that when we write copy:

1. **We are plainspoken.** We understand the world our users are living in: one muddled by hyperbolic language, strange technical jargon, and confusing documentation. We strip all that away and value clarity above all. Because users come to nteract to discover delightful interactive computing experiences, we avoid distractions like fluffy metaphors and cheap plays to emotion. 

2. **We are genuine.** We understand what data scientists, software engineers, and researchers need because we are data scientists, software engineers, and researchers. That means we relate to users' challenges and passions and speak to them in a familiar, warm, and accessible way. 

3. **We are translators.** Only experts can make what’s difficult look easy, and it’s our job to demystify tech-speak and actually educate.

4. **Our humor is dry.** Our sense of humor is straight-faced, subtle, and a touch eccentric. We’re weird but not inappropriate, smart but not snobbish. We prefer winking to shouting. We’re never condescending or exclusive — we always bring our users in on the joke.

## Tone

nteract’s tone is usually informal, but it’s always more important to be clear than entertaining. When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Are they excited to have merged their first pull request? Are they confused and seeking our help on GitHub issues? Once you have an idea of their emotional state, you can adjust your tone accordingly.

nteract has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it’s appropriate and when it comes naturally to you. But don’t go out of your way to make a joke — forced humor can be worse than none at all. If you’re unsure, keep a straight face.
